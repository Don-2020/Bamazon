# Bamazon
```
Welcome to Bamazon! An Amazon-like storefront that was built with MySQL and Node.js. 

There are two portals from which users can view the Bamazon app. A customer portal and a manager portal, both which have unique properties.

 The customer portal allows users to view the inventory and choose which items they would like to purchase along with the quantity they desire.

 The manager portal, allows users view all inventory in the store, view all low inventory (less than 5 items in stock), choose to restock the inventory back to the correct amount needed, and even add new items to your inventory!
